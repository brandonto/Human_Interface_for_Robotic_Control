Summary

    HIRCP is a very simple protocol used by the Human Interface for Robotic
    Control group at Carleton University for communication between HIRC desktop
    controller application and firmware on ARM Cortex-M4 based CC3200-LAUNCHXL
    microcontroller. This document describes the protocol and it's types of
    packets. The document also explains the reasons behind some of the design
    decisions.


1. Purpose

    HIRCCP is a simple protocol used to transfer servo motor position data from
    controller application to microcontroller and transfer pressure data from
    microcontroller to controller application. It is an application layer
    protocol that is implemented on top of Internet Transmission Control
    protocol (TCP). This should not exclude the possibility of implementing
    HIRCCP on top of other transmission protocols like UDP, provided that a
    separate reliability layer exists. It is designed for a very specific
    application. Therefore, it lacks many features present in other haptics
    communication protocols. It can support connection, disconnection,
    servo position streaming (live and recorded), pressure feedback, free mode,
    and closed-loop feedback mode.


2. Overview of the Protocol

    Connection begins with controller application sending a connection request
    packet to the microcontroller acting as a server. If the server grants the
    request, it sends an acknowledgement packet to signal that it is ready to
    receive data or mode packets. Every data packet is acknowledged by a data
    acknowledgement packet. Every mode packet is acknowledged by an
    acknowledgement packet. Connection is terminated by sending a termination
    request packet to the microcontroller. Connection can also be terminated
    on error detection by sending an error packet.

    As previously mentioned, HIRCP is an application layer protocol. This means
    that a HIRCP header will be between the TCP header and the data as shown in
    Figure 2-1. More information on the HIRCP header will be discussed later in
    the document.

                | Ethernet |   IP   |  TCP   | HIRCP  | Data |
                |  Header  | Header | Header | Header |      |
                 --------------------------------------------

3. HIRCP Packets

    HIRCP supports seven types of packets:

        opcode  operation
          1     Connection request (CRQ)
          2     Mode (MODE)
          3     Data (DATA)
          4     Data acknowledgement (DACK)
          5     Termination request (TRQ)
          6     Acknowledgement (ACK)
          7     Error (ERR)

3.1 Connection Request and Mode Packets

                             4 bytes      1 byte  1 byte
                        --------------------------------
                       | HIRCP constant | Opcode | Mode |
                        --------------------------------

                          Figure 3-1: CRQ/MODE packet

    CRQ and MODE packets (opcodes 1 and 2 respectively) have the format shown
    in Figure 3-1. The HIRCP constant is a sequence of bytes with ascii values
    'H', 'I', 'R' and 'C', in that order. The HIRCP constant is used to
    identify that this packet is an HIRCP packet. Any packet that does not have
    this constant in the header should be discarded and ignored by the
    application implementing this protocol. The type of mode is encoded as an
    8-bit integer in the Mode field. A table of modes is given in the appendix.

3.2 Termination Request and Acknowledgement Packets

                                4 bytes      1 byte
                           -------------------------
                          | HIRCP constant | Opcode |
                           -------------------------

                           Figure 3-2: TRQ/ACK packet

    TRQ and ACK packets (opcodes 5 and 6 respectively) have the format shown in
    Figure 3-2.

3.3 Data Packets

       4 bytes      1 byte  1 byte  1 byte  1 byte   1 byte  1 byte  1 byte
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | HIRCP constant | Opcode | Thumb | Index | Middle | Ring  | Pinky | Wrist |
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            Figure 3-3: DATA packet

    DATA packets (opcode 3) have the format shown in Figure 3-3. Rotations in
    degrees for the wrist and each of the five fingers on the right hand are
    encoded into their corresponding fields.

3.4 Data Acknowledgement Packets

         4 bytes      1 byte  2 bytes  2 bytes  2 bytes  2 bytes  2 bytes
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   | HIRCP constant | Opcode | Thumb  | Index  | Middle |  Ring  | Pinky  |
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                            Figure 3-4: DACK packet

    DACK packets (opcode 4) have the format shown in Figure 3-4. Fingertip
    pressure sensor values for each of the five fingers on the right hand are
    encoded into their corresponding fields. Two bytes are needed since values
    read from the analog-to-digital converter are in the range of 0 to 4096.

3.5 Error Packets

                          4 bytes      1 byte    1 byte
                     -------------------------------------
                    | HIRCP constant | Opcode | ErrorCode |
                     -------------------------------------

                            Figure 3-5: ERR packet

    ERR packets (opcode 7) have the format shown in Figure 3-5. The type of
    error is encoded as an 8-bit integer in the ErrorCode field. An ERR packet
    can be the acknowledgment of any other type of packet. A table of error
    codes and types of errors is given in the appendix.


4. Initial Connection

    A connection is established by sending a connection request from the
    controller application to the microcontroller, and receiving a connection
    acknowledgment in response. If an error was received in response, then the
    request has been denied.


5. Normal Communication

    Typical communication involves the controller application sending DATA
    packets to the microcontroller and receiving DACK packets in response. A
    MODE packet should be sent to the microcontroller any time the controller
    application wishes to change modes of operation. The microcontroller should
    respond to MODE packets with an ACK packet.


6. Normal Termination

    A connection is terminated by sending a termination request from the
    controller application to the microcontroller, and receiving a termination
    acknowledgment in response. If an error was received in response, then the
    request has been denied. If a request has been denied for any reason, the
    controller application can terminate the connection and wait for the
    microcontroller to time out due to inactivity before attempting another
    connection. See Section-7 on premature termination for more details.


6. Premature Termination

    A connection can also be terminated prematurely. It is up to the programmer
    to ensure that proper steps are taken in such cases. All sockets should be
    set to non-blocking mode and have a timeout associated with its operations.
    Applications implementing HIRCP should assume that connection is lost on a
    socket timeout and take the necessary actions to free any memory allocated
    for that session. The server should then return to listening for new
    connections on the listen socket. The client should idle for a time greater
    than the timeout before attempting a reconnection. A watchdog timer can be
    used for this purpose if plausible.

    All errors cause termination of connection. Upon receiving or sending an
    error the host should take the actions described previously.
