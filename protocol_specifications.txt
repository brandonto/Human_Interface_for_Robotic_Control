Summary

    HIRCCP is a very simple protocol used by the Human Interface for Robotic
    Control group at Carleton University for communication between HIRC desktop
    controller application and firmware on ARM Cortex-M4 based CC3200-LAUNCHXL
    microcontroller. This document describes the protocol and it's types of
    packets. The document also explains the reasons behind some of the design
    decisions.

1. Purpose

    HIRCCP is a simple protocol to transfer servo motor position data from
    controller application to microcontroller and transfer pressure data from
    microcontroller to controller application. It is an application layer
    protocol that is implemented on top of Internet Transmission Control
    protocol (TCP). This should not exclude the possibility of implementing
    HIRCCP on top of other transmission protocols like UDP, provided that a
    separate reliability layer exists. It is designed for a very specific
    application. Therefore, it lacks many features present in other haptics
    communication protocols. It can support connection, disconnection,
    rotation streaming (live and recorded), and pressure feedback.
